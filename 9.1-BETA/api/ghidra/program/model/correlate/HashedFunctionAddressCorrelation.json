Matching is performed\n via a greedy algorithm that looks for sequences (n-grams) of Instructions that are similar between the two Functions.\n Similarity of two sequences is determined by comparing hashes generated by the HashCalculator object.\n \n 1) Potential sequences and their hashes are generated for both functions (see HashStore).\n 2) Sequences are pulled from the HashStore based on the uniqueness of a potential match and on the size of the sequence.\n 3) If a unique match is found between sequences, it is extended in either direction as far as possible,\n    as constrained by HashCalculator and the containing basic-blocks.\n 4) The matching Instruction pairs are put in the final map and removed from further sequence lists\n    to allow other potential matches to be considered.\n 5) Sequences with no corresponding match are also removed from consideration.\n 6) Sequences are limited to a single basic-block, and the algorithm is basic-block aware.\n    Once a match establishes a correspondence between a pair of basic blocks, the algorithm uses\n    that information to further narrow in on and disambiguate matching sequences.\n 7) If a particular sequence has matches that are not unique, the algorithm tries to disambiguate the potential\n    matches by looking at parent\/child relationships of the containing basic-blocks.
