{"implements":["docking.help.HelpDescriptor","docking.action.ActionContextProvider"],"javadoc":"Abstract base class for creating dockable GUI components within a tool.  \n <p>\n The one method that must be implemented is {@link #getComponent()} which is where the top level\n Swing JComponent is returned to be docked into the tool.  Typically, the GUI components are\n created in the constructor along with any local actions for the provider.  The getComponent() \n method then simply returns the top level component previously created by this provider.\n <p>\n There are many other methods for configuring how to dock the component, set title information,\n configure grouping, set the help, add actions, and receive show\/hide notifications, some\n of which are highlighted below.  Typically, implementers will use these methods to configure\n how the GUI component behaves within the tool, and then add the business logic that uses and reacts\n to the GUI components created in this provider.\n <p>\n To effectively use this class you merely need to create your component, add your actions to \n this class ({@link #addLocalAction(DockingActionIf)}) and then add this provider to the tool\n ({@link #addToTool()}).\n <p>\n This also provides several useful convenience methods:\n <ul>\n  <li>{@link #addLocalAction(DockingActionIf)}\n  <li>{@link #addToTool()}\n  <li>{@link #setVisible(boolean)}  \n  <li>{@link #setTitle(String)}\n  <li>{@link #setIcon(Icon)}\n <\/ul>\n <p>\n There are a handful of stub methods that can be overridden as desired:\n <ul>\n  <li>{@link #componentActivated()} and {@link #componentDeactived()}\n  <li>{@link #componentHidden()} and {@link #componentShown()}\n <\/ul>\n \n <p>\n <b><u>Show Provider Action<\/u><\/b> - Each provider has an action to show the provider.  For\n typical, non-transient providers (see {@link #setTransient()}) the action will appear in \n the tool's <b>Window<\/b> menu.   You can have your provider also appear in the tool's toolbar\n by calling {@link #addToTool()}.\n <p>\n Historical Note: This class was created so that implementors could add local actions within the constructor\n without having to understand that they must first add themselves to the WindowManager.","static":false,"extends":"java.lang.Object","methods":[{"javadoc":"Creates a new component provider with a default location of {@link WindowPosition#WINDOW}.\n@param tool The tool will manage and show this provider\n@param name The providers name.

Typically, the GUI components are\n created in the constructor along with any local actions for the provider.  The getComponent() \n method then simply returns the top level component previously created by this provider.\n \n There are many other methods for configuring how to dock the component, set title information,\n configure grouping, set the help, add actions, and receive show\/hide notifications, some\n of which are highlighted below.  Typically, implementers will use these methods to configure\n how the GUI component behaves within the tool, and then add the business logic that uses and reacts\n to the GUI components created in this provider.\n \n To effectively use this class you merely need to create your component, add your actions to \n this class (#addLocalAction(DockingActionIf)) and then add this provider to the tool\n (#addToTool()).\n \n This also provides several useful convenience methods:\n \n  #addLocalAction(DockingActionIf)\n  #addToTool()\n  #setVisible(boolean)  \n  #setTitle(String)\n  #setIcon(Icon)\n \n \n There are a handful of stub methods that can be overridden as desired:\n \n  #componentActivated() and #componentDeactived()\n  #componentHidden() and #componentShown()\n \n \n \n Show Provider Action - Each provider has an action to show the provider.  For\n typical, non-transient providers (see #setTransient()) the action will appear in \n the tool's Window menu.   You can have your provider also appear in the tool's toolbar\n by calling #addToTool().\n \n Historical Note: This class was created so that implementors could add local actions within the constructor\n without having to understand that they must first add themselves to the WindowManager.","fields":[{"type_long":"java.lang.String","javadoc":"","static":true,"name":"TRANSIENT_PROVIDER_TOOLBAR_WARNING_MESSAGE","comment":"","type_short":"String","constant_value":"\"Transient providers are not added to the toolbar\""},{"type_long":"java.lang.String","javadoc":"","static":true,"name":"TRANSIENT_PROVIDER_KEY_BINDING_WARNING_MESSAGE","comment":"","type_short":"String","constant_value":"\"Transient providers cannot have key bindings\""},{"type_long":"java.lang.String","javadoc":"","static":true,"name":"DEFAULT_WINDOW_GROUP","comment":"","type_short":"String","constant_value":"\"Default\""},{"type_long":"java.lang.String","javadoc":"","static":true,"name":"TOOLBAR_GROUP","comment":"","type_short":"String","constant_value":"\"View\""},{"type_long":"java.util.Map<java.lang.String,java.lang.String>","javadoc":"","static":true,"name":"oldOwnerMap","comment":"","type_short":"Map","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"java.util.Map<java.lang.String,java.lang.String>","javadoc":"","static":true,"name":"oldNameMap","comment":"","type_short":"Map","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"docking.DockingTool","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"dockingTool","comment":"","type_short":"DockingTool","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"java.lang.String","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"name","comment":"","type_short":"String","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"java.lang.String","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"owner","comment":"","type_short":"String","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"java.lang.String","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"title","comment":"","type_short":"String","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"java.lang.String","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"subTitle","comment":"","type_short":"String","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"java.lang.String","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"tabText","comment":"","type_short":"String","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"java.util.Set<docking.action.DockingActionIf>","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"actionSet","comment":"","type_short":"Set","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"boolean","javadoc":"True if this provider's action should appear in the toolbar","static":false,"name":"addToolbarAction","comment":"True if this provider's action should appear in the toolbar","type_short":"boolean","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"boolean","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"isTransient","comment":"","type_short":"boolean","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"docking.action.KeyBindingData","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"defaultKeyBindingData","comment":"","type_short":"KeyBindingData","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"javax.swing.Icon","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"icon","comment":"","type_short":"Icon","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"java.lang.String","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"windowMenuGroup","comment":"","type_short":"String","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"java.lang.String","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"group","comment":"","type_short":"String","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"docking.WindowPosition","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"defaultWindowPosition","comment":"","type_short":"WindowPosition","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"docking.WindowPosition","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"defaultIntraGroupPosition","comment":"","type_short":"WindowPosition","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"docking.action.DockingAction","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"showProviderAction","comment":"","type_short":"DockingAction","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"ghidra.util.HelpLocation","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"helpLocation","comment":"","type_short":"HelpLocation","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"java.lang.Class<?>","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"contextType","comment":"","type_short":"Class","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"long","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"instanceID","comment":"","type_short":"long","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"boolean","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"instanceIDHasBeenInitialized","comment":"","type_short":"boolean","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"java.lang.String","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"inceptionInformation","comment":"","type_short":"String","constant_value":null}]}
