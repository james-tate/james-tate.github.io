{"implements":[],"javadoc":"HashStore is a sorted, basic-block aware, store for Instruction \"n-grams\" to help quickly match similar\n sequences of Instructions between two functions.  The Instructions comprising a single n-gram are hashed\n for quick lookup by the main matching algorithm (HashedFunctionAddressCorrelation).  Hash diversity is\n important to minimize collisions, even though the number of hashes calculated for a single function pair\n match is small.\n \n Hashes are built and sorted respectively using the calcHashes() and insertHashes() methods. The main sort\n is on the number of collisions for a hash (indicating that there are duplicate or near duplicate instruction\n sequences), the hashes with fewer (or no) duplicates come first. The secondary sort is on\n \"n\", the number of Instructions in the n-gram, which effectively describes the significance of the match, or how\n unlikely the match is to occur at random.  The main matching algorithm effectively creates a HashSort for both\n functions, and then in a loop calls\n    hash = getFirstEntry()    on one side to get the most significant possible match\n    getEntry(has)             to see if there is a matching n-gram on the other side\n    \n If there is a match it is declared to the sort with the matchHash() call, allowing overlapping n-grams to be\n removed and deconflicting information to be updated.  If there is no match, hashes can be removed with the\n removeHash() method to allow new hashes to move to the top of the sort.\n \n The store uses a couple of methods to help deconflict very similar sequences of instructions within the same function.\n Primarily, the sort is basic-block aware.  All n-grams are contained within a single basic block, and when an initial\n match is found, hashes for other n-grams within that block (and its matching block on the other side) are modified\n so that n-grams within that block pair can only match each other.","static":false,"extends":"java.lang.Object","methods":[{"javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"<init>","comment":"","params":[{"type_long":"ghidra.program.model.listing.Function","name":"a","comment":"","type_short":"Function"},{"type_long":"ghidra.util.task.TaskMonitor","name":"mon","comment":"","type_short":"TaskMonitor"}],"throws":[{"type_long":"ghidra.util.exception.CancelledException","comment":"","type_short":"CancelledException"}],"return":{"type_long":"void","comment":"","type_short":"void"}},{"javadoc":"@return total number of Instructions in the whole function","static":false,"name":"getTotalInstructions","comment":"","params":[],"throws":[],"return":{"type_long":"int","comment":"total number of Instructions in the whole function","type_short":"int"}},{"javadoc":"@return number of instructions that have been matched so far","static":false,"name":"numMatchedInstructions","comment":"","params":[],"throws":[],"return":{"type_long":"int","comment":"number of instructions that have been matched so far","type_short":"int"}},{"javadoc":"Set up the basic-block and instruction model and the accompanying hash containers\n@throws CancelledException","static":false,"name":"initializeStructures","comment":"Set up the basic-block and instruction model and the accompanying hash containers","params":[],"throws":[{"type_long":"ghidra.util.exception.CancelledException","comment":"","type_short":"CancelledException"}],"return":{"type_long":"void","comment":"","type_short":"void"}},{"javadoc":"Create the basic Block structure, walk the Instructions creating InstructHash structures\n@param codeBlock is the set of instruction addresses corresponding to the basic block","static":false,"name":"createBlock","comment":"Create the basic Block structure, walk the Instructions creating InstructHash structures","params":[{"type_long":"ghidra.program.model.block.CodeBlock","name":"codeBlock","comment":"is the set of instruction addresses corresponding to the basic block","type_short":"CodeBlock"}],"throws":[],"return":{"type_long":"void","comment":"","type_short":"void"}},{"javadoc":"Low level insert of an n-gram into the HashStore\n@param curHash is hash of the n-gram\n@param instHash is (starting Instruction of) the n-gram","static":false,"name":"insertNGram","comment":"Low level insert of an n-gram into the HashStore","params":[{"type_long":"ghidra.program.model.correlate.Hash","name":"curHash","comment":"is hash of the n-gram","type_short":"Hash"},{"type_long":"ghidra.program.model.correlate.InstructHash","name":"instHash","comment":"is (starting Instruction of) the n-gram","type_short":"InstructHash"}],"throws":[],"return":{"type_long":"void","comment":"","type_short":"void"}},{"javadoc":"Insert all n-gram hashes for a particular instruction\n@param instHash is the instruction","static":false,"name":"insertInstructionNGrams","comment":"Insert all n-gram hashes for a particular instruction","params":[{"type_long":"ghidra.program.model.correlate.InstructHash","name":"instHash","comment":"is the instruction","type_short":"InstructHash"}],"throws":[],"return":{"type_long":"void","comment":"","type_short":"void"}},{"javadoc":"Low level removal of a particular n-gram from the sort\n@param instHash is (starting instruction) of the n-gram\n@param curHash is hash (and size) of the n-gram","static":false,"name":"removeNGram","comment":"Low level removal of a particular n-gram from the sort","params":[{"type_long":"ghidra.program.model.correlate.InstructHash","name":"instHash","comment":"is (starting instruction) of the n-gram","type_short":"InstructHash"},{"type_long":"ghidra.program.model.correlate.Hash","name":"curHash","comment":"is hash (and size) of the n-gram","type_short":"Hash"}],"throws":[],"return":{"type_long":"void","comment":"","type_short":"void"}},{"javadoc":"Remove all n-grams associated with a particular instruction\n@param instHash is the particular instruction","static":false,"name":"removeInstructionNGrams","comment":"Remove all n-grams associated with a particular instruction","params":[{"type_long":"ghidra.program.model.correlate.InstructHash","name":"instHash","comment":"is the particular instruction","type_short":"InstructHash"}],"throws":[],"return":{"type_long":"void","comment":"","type_short":"void"}},{"javadoc":"Remove a particular HashEntry.
