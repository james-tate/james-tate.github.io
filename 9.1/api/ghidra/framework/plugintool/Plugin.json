(ie. PluginA requires a service that PluginB provides, which requires a service\n that PluginA provides)\n\n Plugin Service implementation\n A Plugin may provide a service to other Plugins by advertising in its PluginInfo\n annotation that it PluginInfo#servicesProvided() an interface class.\n \n Your Plugin can either directly implement the interface in your Plugin class:\n \n public class MyPlugin extends Plugin implements MyService {....}\n \n or it may delegate the handling of the service interface to another object during its\n constructor:\n \n public MyPlugin(PluginTool tool) {\n ...\n MyService serviceObj = new MyService() { ... };\n registerServiceProvided(MyService.class, serviceObj);\n }\n \n When your Plugin directly implements the advertised service interface, you should not\n call #registerServiceProvided(Class, Object) for that service\n interface.\n \n Service interface classes are just normal java interface declarations and have no\n preconditions or other requirements to be used as a Plugin's advertised service interface.\n \n Optionally, service interface classes can be marked with meta-data via a\n ServiceInfo annotation that can have a\n ServiceInfo#defaultProvider() property which specifies a Plugin's\n class (or classname) that should be auto-loaded to provide an implementation of the service\n interface when that service is required by some other Plugin.  Without the defaultProvider\n information, dependent Plugins will fail to load unless the user manually loads a Plugin\n that provides the necessary interface service.\n \n Multiple Plugins can implement the same service interface.  Plugins that use that\n multi-implemented service will either receive a randomly picked instance if using\n PluginTool#getService(Class) or will receive all implementations if using\n PluginTool#getServices(Class).\n \n\n Plugin Events\n \n \tEvery type of plugin event should be represented by some class extending PluginEvent.\n  One PluginEvent subclass may be used for more than one event type as long as there's some natural grouping.\n \n\n Component Providers\n \n  A plugin may supply a ComponentProvider that provides a visual component when the plugin is added to the tool.\n  TODO - needs more\n \n\n Important interfaces Plugins often need to implement\n \n \tOptionsChangeListener - to receive notification when a configuration option\n \tis changed by the user.\n \tFrontEndable - marks this Plugin as being suitable for inclusion in the FrontEnd tool.\n \tFrontEndOnly - marks this Plugin as FrontEnd only, not usable in CodeBrowser or other tools.\n \tProgramaticUseOnly - marks this Plugin as special and not for user configuration.\n \tTODO\n ","fields":[{"type_long":"ghidra.framework.plugintool.PluginTool","javadoc":"The {@link PluginTool} that hosts\/contains this Plugin.","static":false,"name":"tool","comment":"The PluginTool that hosts\/contains this Plugin.","type_short":"PluginTool","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"java.lang.String","javadoc":"Name of this plugin, derived from the simple class name.","static":false,"name":"name","comment":"Name of this plugin, derived from the simple class name.","type_short":"String","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"ghidra.framework.plugintool.util.PluginDescription","javadoc":"Static information about this Plugin, derived from its {@link PluginInfo} annotation.","static":false,"name":"pluginDescription","comment":"Static information about this Plugin, derived from its PluginInfo annotation.","type_short":"PluginDescription","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"java.util.List<java.lang.Class<?>>","javadoc":"Temporary compatibility for Plugins that have not been updated to new PluginInfo API.\n <p>\n Contains the list of service classes that this plugin registered as being required.\n <p>\n Ignored if the PluginDescription has values for requiredServices.","static":false,"name":"legacyRequiredServices","comment":"Temporary compatibility for Plugins that have not been updated to new PluginInfo API.\n \n Contains the list of service classes that this plugin registered as being required.\n \n Ignored if the PluginDescription has values for requiredServices.","type_short":"List","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"java.util.List<java.lang.Class<? extends ghidra.framework.plugintool.PluginEvent>>","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"eventsProduced","comment":"","type_short":"List","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"java.util.List<java.lang.Class<? extends ghidra.framework.plugintool.PluginEvent>>","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"eventsConsumed","comment":"","type_short":"List","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"java.util.List<ghidra.framework.plugintool.ServiceInterfaceImplementationPair>","javadoc":"","static":false,"name":"services","comment":"","type_short":"List","constant_value":null},{"type_long":"boolean","javadoc":"Flag that indicates that this Plugin's constructor phase has finished.
