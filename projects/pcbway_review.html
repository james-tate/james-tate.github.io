        <h1>PCBWay Review (Custom PCB's delivered in under 7 days)</h1>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom:-20px">March 29 2018</h5>

        <p>A few days ago I posted the announcement for my Kickstarter project <a href="http://hwreblog.com/projects/piso.html">pISO</a>. The project was fully funded a few hours after the post! When the project was first started about 6 months ago on of the major questions my partner and I had was what was the minimum quanity of units we could produce while making them affordable. I set out to get quotes from many PCB fabrication houses that also do assembly. For many years I have used <a href="https://oshpark.com/">OSHPARK</a> for my hobby PCB's. Oshpark is a well known hobbiest PCB source that many people like myself use. However for doing larger scale production their prices are too high for end user affordability. 
        </p>

        <p>During my browsing I came across <a href="https://www.pcbway.com/">PCBWay</a>. I must say before going forward, PCBWay does give discounts for reviews. While discounts on future orders would be great, I will not over inflate as this is my honest review of PCBWay's quality and service. With that being said, PCBWay was by far the cheapest PCB manufacturer and assembly service out of the dozen quotes I reqested for 250 pISO units. The thing that was immediately noticable was their offer of 10 - 2 layer PCB boards 100mmx100mm for only $5.00. Yes! They are advertising 2 layer 100mmx100mm PCB's for $5.00 and you get 10 boards in your order. What's even crazier was the fact they quoted me 7 days for delivery of my PCB's. That's 7 days production and delivery via DHL. Obviously, I was curious about the quality of these PCB's and I think anyone in their right mind would. I talked it over with my partner and we decided to place an order for the 10 PCB $5.00 deal for some prototypes. Since that time I have made a total of 5 orders of various PCB colors and sizes pictured below.</p>
